            description: `Application: As mentioned before, real-world training will present a continuum of landing situations. Sometimes after jumping a gap to land on a precise target, you might need to absorb and stabilize with one leg more than the other. The broad jump to single-leg landing drill is a nice exercise for developing the single-leg strength to control such a landing. Mastering this drill will also help you maintain better mechanics and express more power through the single-leg rebounding movements we will discuss later.`

            description: `Your grip width is the next thing to pay attention to as you train pull-ups. Again, you should be looking for the best translation of skill to other motions. If you use too wide of a grip it will force you to chicken wing your arms during a muscle-up, preventing you from stacking your shoulders above your hands once you are above the bar. So, the ideal grip width is with your hands on the bar directly above your shoulders. There is one other grip-related rule of thumb that you should keep in mind. If the bar is skinny enough to fully wrap your thumb all the way around, you should do so. However, many bars and Pull-up tree branches are too thick to do this, and instead, you should wrap your thumb over the top of the bar with your other fingers. From there the exercise begins from a passive hang with elevated shoulders, transitions into an active hang with depressed shoulders, and then finally the full pull-up motion. You will read more about passive and active hangs on the next page. As you pull yourself upward, the goal is to touch the top of your shoulders to the bar. If you continue the motion into a muscle-up, your hands will be positioned directly under your shoulders, giving you the best stability and ability to push yourself upward.`
